Arcade Fire - Tunnels
=====================

INTRO: F

    F  Am7 F       Am  Dm
And if the snow buries my,
A    Bb          F 
  my neighborhood.
    F             Am7  F 
And if my parents are crying
          Am       Dm
then I'll dig a tunnel
     A     Bb     F 
from my window to yours, 
Am       Dm        A     Bb     F
yeah a tunnel from my window to yours.

F         Am7     F
You climb out the chimney 
            Am     Dm
and meet me in the middle,
    A      Bb     F
the middle of the town.
    F                    Am7  F       
And since there's no one else around,
       Am            Dm 
we let our hair grow long
       A          Bb      F
and forget all we used to know,
         Am         Dm 
then our skin gets thicker
     A          Bb     F 
from living out in the snow. 

F                    Am
You change all the lead 
F               Am
sleepin' in my head,
Dm                 Am
  as the day grows dim
Dm                  C     C7 
  I hear you sing a golden hymn. 


Then we tried to name our babies, 
but we forgot all the names that, 
the names we used to know. 
But sometimes, we remember our bedrooms, 
and our parent's bedrooms, 
and the bedrooms of our friends. 
Then we think of our parents, 
well what ever happened to them?! 

You change all the lead 
sleepin' in my head to gold, 
as the day grows dim, 
I hear you sing a golden hymn, 
the song I've been trying to say. 

Purify the colors, purify my mind. 
Purify the colors, purify my mind, 
and spread the ashes of the colors 
over this heart of mine!
