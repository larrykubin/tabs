i think i'll go home and mull this over
         D1      A1      G1
before i cram it down my throat
        Bm        A1             G1     Em1
at long last it's crashed, the colossal mass
           D1      A1         G1
has broken up into bits in my moat.

Em2      D2       Em2     D2
lift the mattress off the floor
Em2      D2
walk the cramps off
   A2             G2
go meander in the cold
Em2          D2
hail to your dark skin
Em2        D2
hiding the fact you're dead again
Em2  D2               A2           G2         
underneath the powerliness seeking shade
G2
far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason

       Bm       A1     G1        Em1
it's a luscious mix of words and tricks
            D1           A1             G1
that let us bet when you know we should fold
   Bm      A1        G1         Em1
on rocks i dreamt of where we'd stepped
           D1            A1              G1
and of the whole mess of roads we're now on.

Em2       D2        Em2     D2
hold your glass up, hold it in
Em2     D2                  A2              G2
never betray the way you've always known it is.
Em2     D2                Em2
one day i'll be wondering how
         D2                 Em2
i got so old just wondering how
        D2               A2             G2
i never got cold wearing nothing in the snow.

G2
this is way beyond my remote concern 
of being condescending

Bm  G1    D1   A1   Bm    G1    D1
all these squawking birds won't quit.
Bm  G1   D1 A1     Bm  G1  D1
building no-thing, lay-ing bricks.
