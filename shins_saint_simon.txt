The Shines - Saint Simon
========================

VERSE 1:
      Am        E              G                 
After all these implements and texts designed by 
D                C                D
intellects we're vexed to find evidently there's
      G
still so much that hides.
    Am         E               G              
And though the saints dub us divine in ancient 
D                  C            D
fading lines their sentiment is just as hard to 
G
pluck from the vine.


CHORUS:
F                       D
I'll try hard not to pretend 
F                      D          E
allow myself no mock defense as I 

step into the night.


VERSE 2:
Am    E                G                D
Since I don't have the time nor mind to figure 
        C                   D                
out the nursery rhymes that helped us out in 
       G
making sense of our lives
Am            E                G        D   
The cruel, uneventful state of apathy releases me
  C              D                 G
I value them but I won't cry every time one's 

wiped out. 

CHORUS:
F                         D
I'll try hard not to give in 
F                       D         E
batten down to fare the wind 
F                      D
rid my head of this pretense 
F                      D           E
allow myself no mock defense as I 

step into the night

C                G
Mercy's eyes are blue and 
Dm          F   G
when she places them in 
C        G
front of you 
Dm      F       G 
nothing holds a roman 
C      G
candle to 
Dm         F          G
the solemn warmth you feel 
F        C       F        C
