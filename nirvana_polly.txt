Em G             D    C
   Polly wants a cracker
Em  G                  D       C
  I think I should get off her first
Em G                    D    C
 I think she wants some water
Em G              D     C
   To put out the blow torch
 
 
Chorus:
D  C
    It isn't me,
G  A#
    We have some seed
D  C
    Let me clip
G  A#
    Your dirty wings
D  C
    Let me take a ride
G  A#
     Don't cut yourself
D  C
    I want some help
G  A#
    To please myself
D  C
    I've got some rope
G  A#
     You have been told
D  C
    I promise you
G  A#
    I have been true
D  C
    Let me take a ride
G  A#
    Don't cut yourself
D  C
    I want some help
G  A#
    To please myself

2nd verse:
Em G             D    C
   Polly wants a cracker
Em G               D         C
   Maybe she would like some food
Em     G            D     C
   She asks me to untie her
Em   G              D         C
   A chase would be nice for a few

3rd verse:
Em G              D         C
   Polly says her back hurts
Em    G             D     C
  And she's just as bored as me
Em G             D       C
   She caught me off my guard
Em    G              D       C
   It amazes me, the will of instinct
