============================

INTRO

Am///	G///	Dm///	Am///

VERSE

G                                Em 
Do you remember a guy that's been in such an early song?

C                                     D
I've heard a rumor from ground control oh no don't say it's true            

F                                        C         G/B               F
They got a message from the action man, "I'm happy hope you're happy too

                           G              E/G#
I've loved all I've needed love, sordid details following"

A                                        E
The shrieking of nothing is killing, just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis

     G                                      D
And I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair 

C                                         Em
But I'm hoping to kick, but the planet is glowing

CHORUS

F               G              C             Am
Ashes to Ashes, funk to funky, we know Major Tom's a junky

F                      G                Am
Strung out in heaven's high, hitting an all time low

INSTRUMENTAL

G  Dm  Am  Am  G  Dm  Am

VERSE

G		            Em
Time and again I tell myself I'll stay clean tonight
C                                         D
But the little green wheels are following me, oh no not again
F                                 C         G/B               F
I'm stuck with a valuable friend, I'm happy hope you're happy too
                    G                E/G#
One flash of light, but no smoking pistol 
A
I've never done good things
E                         G                                D
I've never done bad things I never did anything out of the blue, woah-a-wo
F				  C
I want an axe to break the ice, I want to come down right now

CHORUS

F               G              C             Am 
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky, we know Major Tom's a junky
F                      G                 Am
Strung out in heaven's high,  hitting an all time low

G///  Dm///  Am///

OUTRO

Am              G                      Dm                   Am
My mama said to get things done, you'd better not mess with Major Tom
