Smashing Pumpkins - Today (acoustic)
====================================

D  A            G
Today is the greatest
                D
Day Iâ€™ve ever known
     A           G
Cant live for tomorrow
                     D
Tomorrows much too long
  A               G
I burn my eyes out
D   A       B              Em
Before I get out 
  G        B          Em
I wanted more
          G          B                   Em
Than life could ever grant
      G          B          Em
Bored by the chore
     G     F#       C# (9f)
Of saving face

D   A                G
Today is the greatest
                  D
Day I have ever known
      A            G
Cant wait for tomorrow
                        D
I might not have that long
    A         G
Ill tear my heart out
D    A      B           Em
Before I get out
        G     D
Pink ribbon scars
      A             Em
That never forget
       G       D
Ive tried so hard
       A              Em
To cleanse these regrets
    G         D
My angel wings
        A             Em
Were bruised and restrained
    G       F#        C#(9f) 
My belly stings
        

 D    A        
Today is
D    G
Today is
D    A       D
Today is
D    A       D     A     G      D
The greatest daaaaaaaaaaay
D           A                B       Em
Daaayyeeeeeeeee
Em           G              B
I want to turn you on
Em           G              B
I want to turn you round
Em          G               B
I want to turn you on
Em          G              D
I want to turn you
D     A             G
Today is the greatest
D    A              G
Today is the greatest day
D   A               G             D  (slowing down)
Today is the greatest day
         A          G        D
That I have ever known
