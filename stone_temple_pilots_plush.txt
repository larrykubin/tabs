Outro

(part I)
And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where ya going to tomorrow?
And I feel that these are lies to come
Would you even care?

(part II)
And I feel it
And I feel it

(part III)
Where ya going to tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

(part I)
And I feel, so much depends on the weather
So is it raining in your bedroom?
And I see, that these are the eyes of disarray
Would you even care?

(part II)
And I feel it
And she feels it

(part III)
Where ya going to tomorrow?
Where ya goin' with the mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she smell alone?

(part IV)
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time, to wait for
tomorrow
