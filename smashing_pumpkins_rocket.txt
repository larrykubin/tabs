Smashing Pumpkins - Rocket (acoustic chords)
============================================

Note: Based on 2007 tour acoustic version, not 
the SD tour acoustic version allthough they are
very close.

These are just the basic chords for the song. Billy changes everything up 
by alternating the chords a bit here and there. So if you want to play an
Dsus2 where it says D it will work aswell. Same goes with a Asus2 or Am7 where 
it says A. I've just put the basic chords down so it'll be a little bit easier 
for you to experiment with.

Also if you find it a bit boring to just play a G chord thru-out the verse you 
can for example throw in a G with a F as the root (See Billys version from Oeiras 
Festival, Portugal, 2007) or add a Cadd9 chord at the end of every phrase, kind of 
like they did with the acoustic versions in 1993.

Enjoy!
