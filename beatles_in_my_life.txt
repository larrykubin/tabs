Beatles - In My Life
====================

Lyrics and Chords
-----------------

A                             F#m
There are places I'll remember 
       Bm Dm      A
All my life though some have changed
A                             F#m
Some for ever not for better
            Bm Dm        A
Some have gone, and some remain.
          F#m                   Bm
All these places have their moments
     G                           A
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
            F#m                     Bm
Some are dead and some are living
    D Dm       A
In my life, I've loved them all

       A                          F#m
But of all these friends and lovers
        Bm Dm A
There is no one compared with you
A                                          F#m
And these memories lose their meaning
       Bm      Dm       A
When I think of love as something new
         F#m                        Bm
Thought I know I'll never lose affection
  G                              A
For people and things that went before
F#m                                   Bm
I know I'll often stop and think about them
D Dm        A
In my life I'll love you more
D Dm        A
In my life I'll love you more
