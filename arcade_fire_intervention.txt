Arcade Fire - Intervention
==========================

Am           F/C      C 
King's taken back the throne
The people learn and they all grow
And choose what they want written on their stone
G             C
All quiet and alone

You can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
I know I want to fight I want to die
Just tell me what to say

Am              E                 F      C    F C
Working for the church while your family dies
Little baby sister gonna lose her mind
Am    E        F                   C    F   C         G
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a hope
C        F        Em
Hear the soldiers groan
G                   C
All quiet and alone

There's something in the air
The people they all sit and stare
And tell me what they point to tell me where
And tell me...

Who's gonna throw the very first stone?
Who's gonna re-set the bone?
Sitting with his head in a sling
I hear the soldier sing

Working for the church while your family dies
Little baby sister gonna lose her mind
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a hope
Hear the soldiers groan
All quiet and alone

Em     C       G
Shine, shine a light
Some day you can teach me how to fight
Em                       C             G          D               G
And honour something for which I would die, but I just don't know what

You know I can taste the fear
Lift me up and take me out of here
And make it all concisely clear
You know I'm gonna fade

Em              B                 C      G    C G
Working for the church while your family dies
Little baby sister gonna lose her mind
Em    B        C              G         C   G         D
Every spark of friendship and love will die without a hope

G        C        Bm
Hear the soldiers groan
D             G
All quiet and alone
Hear the soldiers groan
All quiet and alone
