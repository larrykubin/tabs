So, so you think you can tell,
             Am                  G
Heaven from Hell, blue skys from pain.
                     D                       C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
                      G
Do you think you can tell?

                          C                   D
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                Am                    G                             D
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
                  C                        Am                         G
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Am                                   G                    D
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
                                  C
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
             Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
