Arcade Fire - Intervention
==========================

Am F C x 2
Am F C G C (/F/C)

Am               F        C
The king’s taken back the throne.
Am          F       C
The useless seed is sown.
Am                   F                Em
When they say they’re cutting off the phone,
G                     C   (/F/C)
I tell 'em you're not home

Am F        C
No place to hide,
Am                   F                C
You're fightin' as a soldier on their side
Am              F               Em
You’re still a soldier in your mind
G                       C   (/F/C)
Though nothing's on the line

Am           F             C
You say it’s money that we need,
Am              F              C
As if we’re the only mouths to feed.
Am        F               Em
And no no matter what you say,
G                         C        (/F/C)
There’s some debts you'll never pay.

Am              E                 F      C
Working for the church while your family dies
Am                 E
You take what they give you
F               C
And you keep it inside.
Am    E        F              C
Every spark of friendship and love
                   G
will die without a home
C        F       Em             G        C
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone".

Am    F         C
I can taste the fear.
Am             F              C
Lift me up and take me out of here.
Am            F                Em
Don’t wanna fight, don’t wanna die
G                   C   (/F/C)
Just wanna hear you cry.

Am                    F          C
Who’s gonna throw the very first stone?
Am              F         C
Oh! who’s gonna reset the bone?
Am                F         Em 
Walking with your head in a sling
G                      C    (/F/C)
Wanna hear the soldier sing:

Am                    E               F      C
"Been working for the church while my family dies.
Am               E              F        C
Your little baby sister’s gonna lose her mind.
Am    E        F              C
Every spark of friendship and love
                   G
will die without a home."
C        F       Em             G       C
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone."

Em    C          G
I can taste your fear.
Em                         C               G
It’s gonna lift you up and take you out of here.
Em      C                G
And the bone shall never heal;
D                 G
I care not if you kneel.

Em      C         G
We can’t find you now,
Em                                C        G
But they’re gonna get their money back somehow.
Em           C            G
And when you finally disappear,
           D                  G
We'll just say you were never here.

Em              B
Working for the church while
     C           G
your life falls apart.
Em           B              C             G
Singin' hallelujah with the fear in your heart.
Em    B        C              G
Every spark of friendship and love
                   D
will die without a home."
G        C       Bm             D        G
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone."
G        C       Bm             D        G
Hear the soldier groan, "We'll go at it alone."
