The Shins - Young Pilgrims
==========================

D  Bb  G
A cold and wet November dawn 
D  Bb  C
and there are no barking sparrows 
D  F    A
just emptiness to dwell upon. 

D  Bb  G
I fell into a winter slide 
D  Bb  C
and ended up the kind of kid who goes down chutes too narrow 
D  F    A
just eking out my measly pies. 

Chorus:
G  D  A  D
But I learned fast how to keep my head up 'cause I 
G  D  F  A
know there is this side of me that 
G  D  A  D
wants to grab the yoke from the pilot and just
G  D  F  A
fly the whole mess into the sea. 

D  Bb  G
Another slow train to the coast 
D  Bb  C
some brand new gory art from way on high 
D  F    A
I sink and then I swim all night. 

D  Bb  G
I watch the ice melt on the glass 
D  Bb  C
while the eloquent young pilgrims pass 
D  F  
and leave behind their trail 
C  A
imploring us not to fail.

G  D  A  D
Of course I raised to gather courage from those 
G  D  F  A
lofty tales so tried and true and 
G  D  A  D
if you're able I'd suggest it 'cause this 
G  D  F  A
modern thought can get the best of you.

Bm  D
This rather simple epitaph 
G  A  G  A/Asus4
can save your hide your falling mind 
Bm  D
fate isn't what we're up against 
G  A  G  A/Asus4
there's no design no flaws to find
G  A  G  A/Asus4
there's no design no flaws to find.

G  D  A  D
But I learned fast how to keep my head up 'cause I 
G  D  F  A
know I got this side of me that 
G  D  A  D
wants to grab the yoke from the pilot and just
G  D  F  A
fly the whole mess into the sea.
