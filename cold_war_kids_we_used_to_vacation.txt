Cold War Kids - We Used To Vacation
===================================

Chords are as follows:
Am: x02210
G#/Am: 402210 (throw that pinky out onto the 6th string if you can)
G/Am7: 302010
F#/D7?: 2x0210 or sometimes 2x0212
C: x32010
G: 320033
F: 133211

For the verse, I think it sounds good to hit the root note first, then the rest of the 
with a little muting (so it sounds more like the piano).  Then get into more strumming at 
things could be much worse...".
Then all slow strumming for the chorus.  By the way, this is my first tab, so thanks for 
the hundreds I leached off of before this one.
And sorry for the lack of proper chord names.
