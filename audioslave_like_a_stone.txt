Intro

Am G5 Em7 Am
(played four times)

Verse 1
     Am     G5
On a cobweb afternoon
    Em7           Am
In a room full of emptiness
     Am      G5
By a freeway I confess
     Em7          Am
I was lost in the pages
Am        G5
of a book full of death
Em7               Am
Reading how we'll die alone
    Am                   G5
and if we're good, we'll lay to rest
Em7         Am
anywhere we want to go


Chorus

Am      C       G5      Am
In your house I long to be
Am      C     G5       Am
Room by room, patiently
     F           Am
I'll wait for you there
G5    Am
Like a stone
     F            Am
I'll wait for you there

  E
Alone

Verse 2
          Am       G5
And on my deathbed I will pray
      Em7           Am
To the Gods and the angels
       Am       G5
Like a pagan to anyone
     Em7            Am
Who will take me to Heaven
Am         G5
To a place I recall
Em7            Am
I was there so long ago
    Am                   G5
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled
    Em7              Am
and there you led me on


Chorus

Am      C       G5      Am
In your house I long to be
Am      C     G5       Am
Room by room, patiently
     F            Am
I'll wait for you there
G5      Am
Like a stone
     F            Am
I'll wait for you there
E      E
Alone, Alone


Bridge
    Am    G5     Em             F
And on I read, until the day was gone
      Am       G5       Em                 F
And I sat in regret for all the things I've done
    F             C           G5            Am
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
    F                C            E
And dreamed until my death I will wander on


Chorus

Am      C       G5      Am
In your house I long to be
Am      C     G5       Am
Room by room, patiently
     F            Am
I'll wait for you there
G5      Am
Like a stone
     F            Am
I'll wait for you there
E      E      Am
Alone, Alone
