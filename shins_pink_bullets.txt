Em      D       A       x4

Em           D     A      Em                  D     A
I was just bony hands as cold as a winter pole
Em          D          A       Em                 D      A
you held a warm stone out new flowing blood to hold
Em        D       A     Em                           D      A
oh what a contrast you were to the brutes in the halls
Em              D       A      Em           D    A
my timid young fingers held a decent animal

G          D
Over the ramparts you tossed
G                 D
the scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
G          D                F
tied to a brick sweet as a song
                     C                         D
the years have been short but the days were long

Em         D          A          Em                 D     A
Cool of a temperate breeze from dark skies to wet grass
Em            D         A           Em                  D     A
we fell in a field it seems now a thousand summers passed
Em                      D     A    Em                  D     A
when our kite lines first crossed we tied them into knots
Em              D   A        Em                D    A
and to finally fly apart we had to cut them off

G                       D
Since then it's been a book
               G
you read in reverse
                   D
so you understand less as the pages turn
G               D                 F
or a movie so crass and awkwardly cast
          C                 D
that even I could be the star

C     D           F         G
I dont look back much as a rule
C       D               F         G
and all this way before murder is cool
C        D                      G           C
but your memory is here and i'd like you to stay
           D
a warm light on a winter's day

Em       D     A      x6

G          D
Over the ramparts you tossed
G                   D
the scent of your skin and some foreign flowers
G         D               F
tied to brick sweet as a song
                      C                           F
the years have been short but the days go slowly by 
          C
to loose kites falling from the sky
F               C                    D
drawn to the ground and an end to flight
